# 🎨 Generative Artworks

This repository collects my experiments and projects in **generative art**, created as part of my self-taught journey in creative coding.  

## 📝 Description

Generative art combines code, mathematics, and creativity to produce dynamic and often unpredictable visual works. In this repository, you will find:

- ✏️ Sketches and prototypes exploring different techniques  
- 🧮 Algorithms that generate unique visual compositions  

> **Note:** ⚠️ This is a self-taught project and is continuously evolving, so **it may contain errors** or work-in-progress code.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 💻 Languages: JavaScript, Processing4, p5.js (or others depending on the project)  
- 🧰 Tools: Visual Studio Code, MinGW terminal, p5.js web editor  

## 🚀 How to Execute – MinGW terminal

```bash
cd [absolute path]
